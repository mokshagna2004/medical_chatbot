This is a simple medical chatbot that answers health-related questions using Google AI. It is trained on a custom medical Q&A dataset and can understand natural language. Users can type their questions or ask using voice input, and the chatbot will respond with helpful medical information. It uses LangChain and FAISS for smart searching and Google's Gemini to generate accurate answers.

The project is built using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and voice-to-text support.
